# learning ggplot

We're learning ggplot. it is going to be amazing.

```{r}
ohi_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/OHI_global_data.csv")

 ggplot(data = ohi_data, aes(x = georegion_one)) +  geom_bar()

```
# Another level of plot entirely
* Still having mixed feeling about my result popping on the RMarkdown*

```{r}


my_plot <- ggplot(data = ohi_data, aes(x=OHI_score, fill=georegion_one)) +
  geom_histogram()  

my_plot +    # the plot created in question 1 continued...
  labs(x = "OHI score",
       y = "Number of countries",
       title = "Distribution of OHI scores") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 14),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16)
        )

```
